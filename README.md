# Rose-Shop-
For this project I will create a to go flower shop. The idea is that I will create a shop that deals with ordering a box of roses. The program will first ask the user to type in the rose of choice according to its assigned number. Afterwards the program will ask the amount of roses wanted, however, there is a limited amount you can only purchase. The colors of rose will then be chosen. Afterwards, the program will request you to choose a box color for the roses to be in. Finally, the price of one box will be revealed. 
In order to function this program, I will be using if statements. For example: the type of roses will be assigned to a number. You will then have to choose from a scale of 1-10 the rose you want. If red rose = 10 then the program will return “red rose”.  

First Round: What I hoped to accomplish on the first round in about 2 weeks is for users to select their overall ideal rose box. The program would ask certain questions to list the type of rose, color of box and etc. Moreover, I would like to test functions that could work better. 

Test Plan for 1st Round: The user is prompted to enter the number according to the rose they want. The rose-eden flower's number is 0. User enters 0. The program returns "rose-eden". Furthermore, user enters the number of roses wanted, however the maximum number of flowers is 12. If user enters a number greater than 12, program prints "No one needs that many flowers". If user enters below 12, program prints "Nice and Simple". User enters "yes" or "no" to "Would you like to change the color of your rose". The program prints "Great" if yes and asks what color they would like and for else it prints "Nice". Finally the user must select a box color. 

Reflections and Revisions: The process was good but could be better. I need to input other functions in order ot improve the project. I plan on making changes to the big picture along the way. 

Next steps: I hope to use several different functions and setting up a dictionary. Additionally, asking the user if they would like another order. Ideally, I would like my rose shop to go gobal, therefore, I look forward to expanding the rose shop.
