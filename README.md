# Rose-Shop-
For this project I will create a to go flower shop. The idea is that I will create a rose shop that deals with ordering a box of roses. The program will first ask the type of rose you would like. Afterwards there is a limit on the amount of roses that can be bought, for example: the maximum amount of roses is 10. The colors of rose will then be chosen. Afterwards, the program will request you to choose a box color for the roses to be in. Finally, the price of one box will be revealed. 
In order to function this program, I will be using the return statements For example: the color of the roses will be assigned to a number. You will have to choose from a scale of 1-10 and it will reveal the color. If red =10 then the program will return “red”. Conditional statements will also be used. The program will state: if number of flowers chosen is 1-10 , print “perfect amount” and if number is too low or over print “not enough”.  Chained conditionals will be needed too.
