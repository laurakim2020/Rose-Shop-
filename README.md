# Rose-Shop-
For this project I will create a to go flower shop. The idea is that I will create a shop that deals with ordering a box of roses. The program will first ask the user to type in the rose of choice according to its assigned number. Afterwards the program will ask the amount of roses wanted, however, there is a limited amount you can only purchase. The colors of rose will then be chosen. Afterwards, the program will request you to choose a box color for the roses to be in. Finally, the price of one box will be revealed. 
In order to function this program, I will be using the return statements For example: the color of the roses will be assigned to a number. You will have to choose from a scale of 1-10 and it will reveal the color. If red =10 then the program will return “red”. Conditional statements will also be used. The program will state: if number of flowers chosen is 1-10 , print “perfect amount” and if number is too low or over print “not enough”.  Chained conditionals will be needed too.
